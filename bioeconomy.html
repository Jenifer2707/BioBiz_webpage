                <ul class="ul1">
                    <li>The Indian bio-based chemicals market, which includes chemicals like lactic acid and succinic acid, is growing as part of India’s transition to sustainable manufacturing. By 2025, the global bio-based chemicals market is projected to reach over $100 billion, driven by the growing demand for greener alternatives​. India’s policies, such as the National Biofuels Policy, are facilitating this growth, with specific targets for increasing the production of biofuels and other bio-based chemicals.</li>
                    <li>The government is encouraging the production of bio-based chemicals such as lactic acid, succinic acid, and bioethanol. The Production Linked Incentive (PLI) scheme aims to boost the manufacturing of these chemicals by providing financial incentives to industries investing in sustainable processes.</li>
                    <li>The global market for bio-based adhesives is expected to grow significantly. The demand for sustainable packaging, particularly in industries like paper and construction, is driving the market for bioadhesives, projected to grow at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 9.6% between 2024 and 2030.</li>
                    <li>Under various government initiatives like the Production Linked Incentive (PLI) Scheme and BIRAC (Biotechnology Industry Research Assistance Council), India is providing financial incentives to encourage the development of bio-based chemicals and materials. These initiatives are aligned with the country’s goal to increase its bioeconomy contribution to $150 billion by 2025.</li>
